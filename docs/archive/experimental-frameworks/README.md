### Framework Overview

The Six-Organization Framework proposed a structured collaboration model with:

1. **Project Management Organization** (PMO)
2. **Implementation Organization**
3. **Quality Assurance Organization**
4. **Retrospective & Planning Organization**
5. **Advisory Organization**
6. **Architecture Organization**

### Why Archived?

- Framework was designed for larger team structures (5-20+ people)
- Current ReflectGuard development is effectively handled by lightweight agile practices
- The overhead of maintaining six separate organizations was deemed unnecessary
- Core practices (TDD, code review, retrospectives) are maintained without formal org structure

### Historical Value

These documents provide valuable insights into:
- Comprehensive collaboration patterns
- RACI decision matrices
- Meeting structures and rhythms
- Communication channel design

They may serve as reference for future scaling considerations.
